# Image-Filter-for-a-Color-Deficient-Person
A color deficient person cannot distinguish the difference between some colors. Such deficiency is known as color blindness. Such condition is caused by the absence of some color-sensitive pigment in the retinaâ€™s cone cells. Out of all the persons diagnosed by color blindness, 90% of them will be suffering from some kind of red-green deficiency in which they cannot distinguish red and green color. Aim of the project is to develop a filter for a color blind person so that they can perceive the image details and color dynamics in much better way and try to explore the effectiveness of different method to do the same in order to improve the vision of a color blind person.
